# August 30, 2025 Update: Minor improvements have been made to the Task Manager:

Hello World!

1.Features and Improvements
   - bug fixes
   - Added update times for CPU percentage and process refresh

2.Additional notes:

The project is considered incomplete for now. I'll continue to improve it at some point.

The program is still imperfect, so I'll keep improving it as fast as I can. Once it's done, you can use it! :D 
Feel free to use the code as a base for your own task manager.

Task Manager inspired by Glances.
