# August 30, 2025 Update: Minor improvements have been made to the Task Manager:

Hello World!

1.Features and Improvements
   - bug fixes
   - Added update times for CPU percentage and process refresh

2.Additional notes:

The project is considered incomplete for now. I'll continue to improve it at some point.

I asked an AI to help me with and explain some parts of this code. I'm new to programming and wanted to make my project a reality, so I apologize if the code contains any bugs

Feel free to use the code as a base for your own task manager.

Task Manager inspired by Glances.
